\section{Comparison to Other Tools}
\label{sec:comparison}

In this section, we compare our generic approach to
checker-specific inference tools. We probably compare
on our nullness benchmarks against the nullness-specific
tools. We might compare against CFI.

We hope that the results show that WPI is about as good as
the other approaches. The relative advantage of WPI is that
it doesn't require any custom code, unlike the others.

A table presents the results.
