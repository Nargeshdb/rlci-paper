\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

This section is our main evaluation. Our evaluation has two goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item show that WPI is \emph{effective}: it can infer most of the
  annotations that humans have written in prior case studies.
\item show that WPI is \emph{general}: without any extra per-checker work,
  we can apply it to lots of checkers.
\end{itemize}

\input{table-case-studies}

Our methodology is to collect a set of projects that have been annotated
by humans, remove the annotations, and then run WPI.
The results appear in \cref{tab:case-studies}.

\input{table-checkers}

We also broke out the results by checker, in \cref{tab:checkers}. We discuss
the results.
