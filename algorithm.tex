\section{Our Generic Type Inference Algorithm}
\label{sec:core-algorithm}

This section presents the core WPI fixpoint algorithm. It almost
certainly contains an ``algorithm 1'' figure. It might also contain
some background on pluggable types. This section also discusses why
this approach is sound---the verifier does eventually run at the end
with the final set of annotations.
