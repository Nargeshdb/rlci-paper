  \caption{
    WPI performance on human-annotated benchmarks. ``Annotated for'' is
    the names of the typecheckers for which human annotations were written
    (see \cref{tab:checkers} to understand the codes).
    ``NCNB LoC'' is the number of lines of non-comment, non-blank code.
    ``Annos.'' is the number of human-written annotations, across all typecheckers.
    ``WPI \% Inferred'' is the percentage of the human-written annotations that WPI
    inferred.
